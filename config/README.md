The docs for the collection is not always easy to parse.
Please note you *have* to create objects in a certain order,
and note that the roles for teams and users are not always what
you expect.

Oddity number one: Why is not users part of an organization when
you make them member of a Team that is? There is no way to add
org memberships to a user, AFAIK.
